# Time Complexity 

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the 
argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

#### Theoratical Analysis
- Iterative factorial
    ```
    ans = 1     # 1
    for i in range(i,n):    # i increament also permormed n times
        ans=ans*i           # n * 1
    return ans              # 1
    ```
    `2n + 2 -> k1 + k2n`
    changing into Big O
