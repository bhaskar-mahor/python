Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the miniting behavior of a function
when the argument tends towards a particular value of inifinity.

Different types of time complexity
1. Constant time - O(1)
2. Linear time - O(n)
3. Logarithmic timem - O(log n)
4. Quadratic time - O(n^2)
5. Cubic time - O(n^3)
